    "For a long time I've been resisting investing in a computer I could use for serious ML. A few weeks ago I gave in and treated myself to [high-end pre-built gaming PC](https://www.newegg.com/abs-ali511/p/N82E16883360111?Item=N82E16883360111&utm_medium=TraEmail&utm_source=TEMC-Shipping-New-Tracking-Notification-Responsive-US&cm_mmc=TEMC-Shipping-New-Tracking-Notification-Responsive-US-_-N82E16883360111), \n",

    "| CPU | Intel i9 10850K | With a respectable 10 cores and 20 threads, this processor is nothing to shake a stick at. Released mid 2020, it was [raved](https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-core-i9-10850k-is-unleashed-but-10-core-comet-lake-cpu-might-not-be-as-affordable-as-you-hoped) as a \"beast\" and one of the fastest gaming processors available. Suffice it to say, it is powerful and the technology is current. |\n",
    "| Storage | 1 TB SSD (M.2 NVMe)| Much faster data transfer than conventional HDD with a spinning magnetic platter |\n",
    "| RAM | 2x 32 GB cards (64GB total) | Lots of RAM so I can work with large datasets |\n",
    "| GPU | RTX 3090 | undoubtedly the highest-end consumer grade GPU currently on the market boasting NVIDIA new Ampere architecture |\n",
    "| VRAM | 24 GB | The main reason I got the 3090. Need lots of VRAM to accomodate large models like transformers |\n",

    "Yes, this machine was designed to be a gaming PC, bit those specs position it to be a fairly powerful ML workstation as well. It would be nice if it had multiple GPUs, \n",
    "but you gotta pick your battles so I went with the one monster GPU and I think I made the right choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The computer came with windows pre-installed, and I decided to give it a chance. After all, I worked at Microsoft when I bought the thing, I should be \"dogfooding\" our \n",
    "products. Microsoft had been boasting about the windows ML runtime and WSL integration so I figured it was worth giving windows a chance. \n",
